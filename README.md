## Setup
This section talks about how to deploy the bot to your Discord server.

### Creating the Bot via Discord Developer Portal
The official instructions for creating a Discord Bot are located on the [discord.py home page](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html).

This bot requires *no* Privileged Gateway Intents.

Currently *no* permissions are required for the bot to operate as only slash commands are used.
